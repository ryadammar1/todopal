Feature: Deny Student Task Completion

As a registered TodoPal teacher
I would like to deny the student's task as incomplete
So that the student can complete or redo the task.

Scenario Outline: Declining the student's task, marking it as incomplete (Normal Flow)

    Given a task "lab 1" is marked as "Done" by "Taha", with email "taha@pattomail.com"
    And task "lab 1" is worth "5" points
    And teacher "Michael Scott" is logged in with email "michael.scott@gmail.com"
    When "Michael Scott" marks "lab 1" as incomplete with message "this work is not sufficient"
    Then "lab 1" will be marked as "In Progress"
    And the message "this work is not sufficient" will be displayed in the task details
