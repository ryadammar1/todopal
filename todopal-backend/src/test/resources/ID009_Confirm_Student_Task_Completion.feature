Feature: Confirm Student Task Completion

As a registered TodoPal teacher
I would like to confirm a student's task as complete
So that the student can be awarded points for officially completing a task.

Scenario Outline: Confirming the student's completed task as closed (Normal Flow)

    Given a task "lab 1" is marked as "Done" by "Taha", with email "taha@pattomail.com"
    And task "lab 1" is worth "5" points
    And teacher "Michael Scott" is logged in
    When "Michael Scott" marks "lab 1" as officially complete
    Then "lab 1" will be marked as "Closed"
    And "5" points will be added to the tally of student "Taha"

Scenario: Mark a task as completed and then close it (Alternate flow)
    Given a task "lab 1" is not marked as done by "Taha", with email "taha@pattomail.com"
    And task "lab 1" is worth "5" points
    And teacher "Michael Scott" is logged in
    When "Michael Scott" marks "lab 1" as officially complete
    Then "lab 1" will be marked as "Closed"
    And "5" points will be added to the tally of student "Taha"
