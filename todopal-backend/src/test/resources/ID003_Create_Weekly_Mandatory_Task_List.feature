Feature: Create Weekly Mandatory Task List

As a registered TodoPal Teacher
I would like to create an empty weekly mandatory task list
So that I can add new tasks to it and publish it later for students to see

Scenario Outline: Teacher creating task list with a list name (Normal Flow)

Given teacher <name> with teacher email <email> is logged in
When teacher <name> creates a weekly mandatory task list with list name <list_name>， start date <start_date> and end date <end_date>
Then the weekly mandatory task list with list name <list_name>, start date <start_date> and end date <end_date> is created under teacher <name>

| name	       | email             	    | list_name		| start_date    	| end_date  	|
